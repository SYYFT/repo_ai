# ðŸ“‚ DDL (Data Definition Language)

## Overview
The **DDL** folder contains SQL scripts for defining and managing the database structure. DDL commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects like tables, schemas, and indexes. These scripts help establish the structure of the database without affecting the data itself.

## Key Operations
- **CREATE**: Defines new database objects, such as tables and schemas.
- **ALTER**: Modifies the structure of existing objects, such as adding or removing columns from a table.
- **DROP**: Deletes entire database objects, removing them from the database.
- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all data from a table quickly, without logging individual deletions.

## Folder Contents
- Scripts for creating tables, schemas, indexes, and other database structures.
- Modifications to existing database objects to accommodate new requirements.

## Usage
Run the scripts in this folder to set up or modify the database structure. Be cautious with `DROP` and `TRUNCATE` commands, as they can permanently delete objects or data.
