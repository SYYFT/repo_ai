# ðŸ“‚ DML (Data Manipulation Language)

## Overview
The **DML** folder contains SQL scripts for manipulating data within the existing database structure. DML commands are used to insert, update, delete, and query data within tables. These scripts interact with the data itself, rather than altering the structure of the database.

## Key Operations
- **INSERT**: Adds new records into tables.
- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing records in tables.
- **DELETE**: Removes specific records from tables.
- **SELECT**: Retrieves data from tables, allowing for queries and data analysis.

## Folder Contents
- Scripts for inserting test data, updating records, and deleting records as needed.
- Queries for retrieving specific data to verify the integrity and functionality of the database.

## Usage
Run the scripts in this folder to populate or modify data within the database. Use these commands cautiously, as they alter data within the tables.
