✅ To-Do List for Tomorrow
1️⃣ Connect fileExplorer.tsx to parser/parser.py

Ensure fileExplorer.tsx can send data to parser.py via API or direct method.
Test if parser.py processes the received data correctly.
Debug any issues with communication between the two components.
2️⃣ Begin UI Design for preRepoAi.tsx

Outline the component layout.
Implement a basic UI structure with placeholders.
Decide on styling and functionality.
3️⃣ Fix webpack.yml so the pipeline runs correctly

Identify why the pipeline fails when merging into main.
Ensure Webpack dependencies are installed properly.
Check Webpack configuration (webpack.config.js) and adjust webpack.yml.
Run tests to verify pipeline success before merging.
🔹 Bonus: If time allows, refactor any messy parts of the codebase to improve maintainability.
